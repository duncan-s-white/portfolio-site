## About

> I am a web developer from Nottingham with experience of front end and back end technologies.

Recently I have completed a skills bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/),
which was a fast paced and enjoyable course, mostly using Javascript with Node and NPM.

This course has helped to broaden my skills, in particular using test driven development, whilst also maintaining relevance with current tools and technologies.

My next target is to further expand my knowledge and skill set as I have a passion for learning about new technology.
