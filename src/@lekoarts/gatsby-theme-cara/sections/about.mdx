## About

> I am a web developer from Nottingham with experience of front end and back end technologies.

Most recently I have completed a skills bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/),
Which was a fast paced and enjoyable course, mostly using javascript with node and npm.

It has helped to broaden my skills, in particular using test driven development, and also maintaining relevance with current tools and technologies.

My next target is to further expand my knowledge and skill set, as I have a passion for learning about new technology.
