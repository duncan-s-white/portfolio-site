## About

> I am a web developer from Nottingham with experience of front end and back end technologies.

I have most recently completed a skills bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/). It was a fast paced and enjoyable course, using javascript for development.

I took the course to keep my skills current, and relevant and to collaborate and work with others.
