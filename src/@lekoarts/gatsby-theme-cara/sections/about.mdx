## About

> I am a web developer from Nottingham with experience of front end and back end technologies.

Most recently I have completed a skills bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/),
Which was a fast paced and enjoyable course, using javascript for development.

It has helped to expand my sklls, particularly with test driven development, and maintain relevance with current tools and technologies.

My next target is to further expand my knowledge and skill set, as I have a passion for learning about new technology.
