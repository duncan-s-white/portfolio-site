## About

> I am a web developer from Nottingham with experience of front end and back end technologies.

Recently I have completed a full-stack software development bootcamp run by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/),
which was a fast paced and enjoyable course, mostly using Javascript with Node and NPM.

This course has helped to broaden my skills, in particular using test driven development, whilst also maintaining relevance with current tools and technologies.

I am currently studying online tutorials for C# and Laravel to further expand my knowledge and skill set, as I have a passion for learning about web technologies.
